## foursquare history map ##

View all of the venues you've checked in on a map.

### Usage:

* Run the history grabber:

  $ ruby history.rb

  It will ask for your Foursquare credentials, then grab all your checkins.

  The checkins will be saved in history.json. Feel free to play with your data.

* Start the server:

  $ ruby app.rb

* Open http://localhost:4567 in your browser for a friggin sweet Google map.

### TODO

* Add more information to info markers on map, like times checked in or something.
* Make it deployable
